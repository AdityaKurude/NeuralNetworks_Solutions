# NeuralNetworks_Solutions
This Repository contains Solution for the Neural Network assignment. Detailed testing steps for ifferent part of the solution are described as follows.

1. NNSolutionOne

required directory path : your_path/NeuralNetworks_Solutions/NNSolutionOne/src/nnsolutionone

compile the Java file from command line using JavaCompiler.
eg. javac -cp ../../dist/NNSolutionOne.jar NNSolutionOne.java

run/execute the binary from command line using JRE.
eg. java -cp ../../dist/NNSolutionOne.jar nnsolutionone.NNSolutionOne

For the part one of the solution :
The inputs are received in the following order: architecture
The program should give the output in the following order: architecture , weights


eg. 

java -cp ../../dist/NNSolutionOne.jar nnsolutionone.NNSolutionOne 
Enter architecture of the ArtNeural Network:
